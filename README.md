# Name
**Where Should We Go This Weekend?**

## Description & Features
This application enables users to check the weather forecast for up to four different zip codes at once. Using the forecasts in front of them they can decide where they want to visit that weekend. 

## Visuals


## Technologies Used
jQuery, HTML, CSS

## Future Enhancements
I would like to update this app to make suggestions based on the weather. Maybe it has a dropdown initially asking what activities you want to do that weekend. If you select ski/snowboard then it would recommend you visit the colder/snowier zip code. If you say you want to relax and swim it would recommend a drier and warmer climate.
